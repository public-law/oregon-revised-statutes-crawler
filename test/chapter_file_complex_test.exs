  Test a 'complex' Chapter File, 837. It's complex because it has:

  * Sub-chapters,
  * Sub-sub-chapters,
  * Embedded tables, and
  * "Note" paragraphs on some Sections.

  The source file is served from:

  https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors837.html

  The fixture was made by downloading it verbatim with curl.
