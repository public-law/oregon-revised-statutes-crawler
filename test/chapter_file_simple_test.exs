  Test a 'simple' Chapter File, 838. It's simple because it has no
  sub-chapters, no sub-sub-chapters, and no embedded tables or forms
  in the sections. The original file is served from:

  https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors838.html

  The fixture was made by downloading it verbatim with curl.
